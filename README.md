# Traingle-Helper
A simple Java program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

This Java program, named TriangleHelper, allows the user to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle. It takes two integer inputs representing the two perpendicular sides of the triangle and then computes the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem formula:
​
                                             System.out.println("Formula: √(a² + b²)");

The result is displayed as a double value.
It’s a simple and educational program ideal for beginners learning Java, mathematical operations, and console input/output handling with the Scanner class.

# 🧮 Triangle Helper

## 📖 Overview
**TriangleHelper** is a simple Java console application that calculates the **hypotenuse** of a right-angled triangle using the **Pythagorean theorem**.  
The program prompts the user to enter the two perpendicular sides (`a` and `b`), computes the hypotenuse (`c`), and displays the result.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Reads user input from the console using the `Scanner` class.
- Calculates the hypotenuse using the `Math.sqrt()` method.
- Displays the result with a clear and formatted message.
- Great for beginners to learn basic Java input/output and math operations.

## 🧩 Formula Used
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

Where:
- **a** = first side  
- **b** = second side  
- **c** = hypotenuse

## 🖥️ Example Output
First Side :
3
Second Side :
4
Hypotenuse : 5.0
